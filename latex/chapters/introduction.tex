\chapter{Introduction}

This case study aims on to make the inversion of a single-element feedforward neural network. The implementation of the inversion is just the last step during the process, due to it needs a lot of preprocessing to make the appropriate model.

There are three main tasks are being tackled in this paper: data mining for extracting information from the data set, neural networks for training the data set, and the inversion itself. The most important thing which interweaves these tasks is machine learning.
